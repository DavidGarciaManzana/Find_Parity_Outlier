# Trimming_String

In a world of data, there lived an array of integers. This array was either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers, except for a single integer named N. N was different from the rest of the integers in the array and was always looking for a way to stand out.

You have been challenged to bring N to the forefront, as it stands out among the rest of the integers in the array.
